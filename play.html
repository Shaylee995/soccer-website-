    <h1> The rules of soccer</h1>
    <!-- specfic rules on how to play explained-->
    <h4> Game time</h4>
    <ul> The game is 90 minutes long broken up into halves of 45 and in those 45 minutes of play there is no stopping of the clock other than when someone is injured or after someone scores. Not even if the ball goes out of bounds.</ul>
    <h4> Hand ball</h4>
    <ul> You are not allowed to touch the ball with your hand whilst in play for no reason and a hand ball classifies as any thing below the arm sleeve line.</ul>
    <h4> Throw ins</h4>
    <ul> When the ball goes out on the sides of the pitch, it must be picked up and thrown over your head to resume play.</ul>
    <h4> Goal kicks</h4>
    <ul> When the ball goes out on the goal sides of the field by the team whos defending, it must be kicked from the corner of the field to resume play from the attacking team.</ul> <ul> But if the ball goes out on the attacking team initially, then the team who was defending gets to resume play from the goalie box which is why its called a goal kick. </ul>

    <h1> How to play</h1>
    <h4> Passing</h4>
    <ul>If you want to pass it across the floor normally, you must hit it with the inside of your foot</ul>
    <ul>If you want to pass it with some curve in the air for something such as a cross u hit it with the inside of ur foot but with a curling motion on the bottom of the ball to also lift and curl it.</ul>
    <ul>If you want to ping it to someone which is the action of hitting it with your laces with some backspin by hitting the bottom of the ball to make it easier to control on a long distance pass.</ul>
    <!-- This is teaching you how to shoot a Soccer ball -->
    <h4>Shooting</h4>
    <ul>If you want to shoot it in the air with the curl much like for the pass, you must hit it with the inside of your foot at the bottom of the ball with an emphasis on lifting ur foot up to make it dip in.</ul>
    <ul>If you want to shoot it with straight power and not curve like the kick before, you must hit it with the laces of ur shoe but keeping ur head down so it doesnt rise while aiming it to one of the corners whether that is to the bottom or top corner.</ul>
    <ul>If you want to shoot it with the "trivela" technique, you must hit it with the outside of your foot at the bottom of ball to get the height on it. But u cant come at it with a normal run up if u were to shoot on ur strong foot, you must approach it like u taking a weak foot shot then hit it with the outside of your strong foot to curl it in.</ul>
